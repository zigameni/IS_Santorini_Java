# IS_Santorini_Java
Santorini is an board, strategy game. 
The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps:  
  1. Move - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. 
      You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.  
  2. Build - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, 
      place a dome instead, removing that space from play.  

Winning the game - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win.
